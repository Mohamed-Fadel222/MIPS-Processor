# CSE112
This is Summer 2023 Computer Organization and Architecture Major task. 
In Phase I, tasks include implementing the MIPS register file, modifying the ALU, 
and connecting modules to design a basic MIPS CPU capable of specific instructions. 

Phase II,  extends the CPU's capabilities to execute R, I, and J instructions. 
This phase involves implementing a control module, connecting it with the MIPS module, 
memory modules, and testing the CPU with a simple program.
